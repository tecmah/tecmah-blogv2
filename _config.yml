# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This blog serves as a place to document the thoughts and experiences I gain while embarking on daily new challenges. It's not written specifically for anyone else.
  In facing new challenges, there are often times when I make mistakes, and my viewpoint may differ from those of my readers. However, all of these are part of my valuable experiences.
  What I value here is sharing these challenges and thoughts with you all.
  So, if you share something with me, it will be of great help to my new challenges.
